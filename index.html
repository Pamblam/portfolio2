				<h1>I am Robert.</h1>
				<p>I make software.</p>
				<p>With over three decades of experience as a human and nearly two decades of experience building tools for humans, I enjoy making things that are intuitive and easy to use. Simple is elegant.</p>
	
				<h3>I'm not a Robot, I swear.</h3>

				<p>As a human myself, I sometimes do things other than write code, here are some photos to prove it. I'm a father to a 15 year old girl (shown below when she was much cuter), fiance to an absolute babe, an avid runner, weightlifter and all-around fitness enthusiast, and casual SCUBA diver.</p>

				<h3>I love code.</h3>

				<p>I write elegant code that is clean, concise, and well-documented. I contribute to and host several well received open source projects.</p>
